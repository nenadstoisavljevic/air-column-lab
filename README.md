# Air Column Lab

A report written for SPH3U0

This lab report explores the different resonant patterns for standing waves in a closed air column. Through the use of the universal wave equation, I explain how the length of the tube and the frequency of the sound waves are inversely proportional, which is why I heard the frequency of the sound waves increasing as the length of the tube was decreasing. Calculations for the speed of sound in average room temperature were made, as well as solving the wavelength for the lower and higher frequencies of sound waves.

The following observations were made with [phyphox](https://phyphox.org/), a great free and open source application that uses the sensors in a mobile phone for physics experiments. For this particular experiment, the `audio spectrum` was used to collect data for resonating sound frequencies in a closed air column. In the end, resulted three distinctive curves which indicated the first three harmonics that the microphone was picking up.
